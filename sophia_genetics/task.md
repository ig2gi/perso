## Introduction



## Tasks
#### 1. Alternative methods to display the same data
_as in Figure 1 (circos plot data + tabular data)_


#### 2. Ideas for how the user could navigate the circos plot intuitively 
_to look at both details and an overview as appropriate_



#### An estimate for the time you would require to produce the circos functionality, 
_and how you would go about it (what technologies would you choose)_

#### What do you expect to be the bottleneck in producing the circos graphic dynamically 
_(ie in near real time) â€“ are you confident it can be done ?_


## Conclusion
